![Midnight Theme: Preview Image](newpreview.png)

Midnight is a user style for RobloxForum.com.

Designed for using RobloxForum at night or alongside a dark desktop theme, Midnight provides more muted, easy-on-the-eyes visuals.
## How to install
Midnight can be used with any browser extension that allows CSS overwriting. 

The easiest way to install Midnight is via the [UserStyles website](https://userstyles.world) alongside [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/):
1. Download and install the Stylus browser addon ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) | [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/stylus/) | [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/styl-us/))
2. Go to the [Midnight page on UserStyles](https://userstyles.world/style/1231/midnight) and click "Install" below the preview image
3. On the new Stylus tab, click the "Install" button and the theme will apply on new and opened RobloxForum tabs.
4. Done!

If your browser does not support the Stylus theme, search for a supported user styles manager and paste [source](source.css) into its editor.
